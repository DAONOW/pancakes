# Pancakes

## A collection of open source resources for smart contracts

Projects using smart contracts rarely offer their solutions under an open source license. Pancakes aims to be a curated collection of open source smart contracts, resources and best practices for developing them.
The goal of Pancakes is to provide an overview as well as open source examples for individual software developers and companies. It includes well structured documentation and serves as a reference for the development of reliable smart contracts.

The smart contract examples are based on best practices of blockchain infrastructure use cases.

Documentation includes curated resources, libraries, tools and more for the creation of smart contracts. Step-by-step instructions, images and screenshots will be part of the documentation.
